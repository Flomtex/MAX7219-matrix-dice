# MAX7219 Matrix Dice ðŸŽ²

This is a **beginner-friendly Arduino project** that displays a digital dice roll (1â€“6) on an 8x8 LED matrix using the MAX7219 chip.

Itâ€™s built as a **Minimum Viable Project (MVP)** â€” just enough code to demonstrate how to:

- Display custom graphics using a matrix
- Use a button to trigger a dice roll
- Organize patterns using `PROGMEM` arrays

## ðŸ§  Why This Project?

This is part of a personal learning journey into Arduino programming. It's meant to be clear, hackable, and easy to build upon.

## ðŸ”§ What's Included?

- `dicematrix.ino` â€“ Main sketch for the dice logic
- `numbers.h` â€“ Bitmaps for dice faces stored in flash memory

---

## ðŸ§ª Status

âœ… MVP complete  
ðŸ”œ Future additions may include:
- Smoother animation
- Multiple matrix support (for snake eyes!)
- Sound feedback or vibration
- 3D printed enclosure files

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Arduino Uno, Nano, or Mega
- 8x8 LED matrix with MAX7219
- Pushbutton (for rolling the dice)
- [LedControl library] by Eberhard Fahle
